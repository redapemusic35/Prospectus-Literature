Meet a Facebook Data Scientist: Q&A with Adam Kramer March 29, 2012 at 11:55 AM

Adam Kramer is a Data Scientist at Facebook researching emotion expression, psycholinguistics and statistical methods. Read on to learn how he uses his background in psychology to understand behavior on Facebook, how his research influences the product and get his top tip for graduate students.

Q: Why did you join Facebook?

A: Facebook data constitutes the largest field study in the history of the world. Being able to ask—and answer—questions about the world in general is very, very exciting to me. At Facebook, my research is also immediately useful: When I discover something, we can use this to make improvements to the product. In an academic position, I would have to have a paper accepted, wait for publication, and then hope someone with the means to usefully implement my work takes notice. At Facebook, I just message someone on the right team and my research has an impact within weeks if not days.

Q: What are some of the interesting questions you’ve answered since you’ve been here?

A: Do emotions spread contagiously? What do the words we choose have to say about how we are and who we are?

Q: What about the work you do here is meaningful? Why do you come to work in the morning?

A: All of the work here is meaningful because it contributes to a better understanding of how people communicate and interact with each other.

Q: What’s your advice for other graduating Psychology researchers?

A: Learn how to program. Even if you aren’t interested in a job like being a Facebook Data Scientist or an industry job in general, the biggest wastes of time I saw in graduate school were point-and-click data manipulation tasks in programs like Excel or SPSS. Start by doing your statistical analyses in R, and after the learning curve, you will find that your ”results” sections are much, much faster to write!



Q: What do you do for fun?

A: I‘m a referee for the Bay Area Derby Girls, a woman’s flat-track roller derby league in the Bay Area. I can also be found singing karaoke at least once a week.
